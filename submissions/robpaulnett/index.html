					<h1>A church of two tales:  The Robinetts and Churchill</h1>
					<article>
						<img src="" />
						<p>There are actually a few stories interwoven here.  Those stories involve Sir Winston Churchill, President Harry S. Truman, John Milton who authored Paradise Lost, William Shakespeare, William Penn of Pennsylania fame, Allen Robinett and finally, Erica and I.  A concise account is in the box immediately below this one.   A more complete version of those stories is told as you scroll down through this page. (there is also a bit of random trivia thrown in at the very bottom of the page).
							If you are paying close attention you have also noticed that I keep spelling my last name incorrectly.  "Robinett" was the traditional spelling.  There are many variations of the name, one of which is mine, Robnett.

						<h2>The Robinetts Then &amp; Now</h2>
						<h3>A Bit of Robinett Geneology</h3>
						<p>Allen Robinett is Paul's ancestor and was married in The Church of St Mary, in London, 362 year ago.  He is my great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather.  That's 11 greats!  Allen Robinett was neither the first nor the only Robinett to emigrate to America in the 17th century from England. We have records of three members of the Robinett name who were in the Jamestown Colony in Virginia and two who were in Maryland long before Allen came in 1682. However, Allen is the only one who left known descendants in America.  Allen Robinett was born in England about 1632; he died June 5, 1694 in Upper Providence Township, Chester/Delaware County, Pennsylvania. On September 29, 1653, Allen married Margaret Symm at The Church of St Mary Aldermanbury in London, England.  Sometime after his marriage in 1653 and prior to 1666, Allen and his family moved to Bunbury, Cheshire, England. Records of the christening of his two sons, Allen and Samuel, are found in the register of St. Boniface, the Bunbury Parish Church, for 1666, and 1669.</p>

						<h2>Ye Olde Word of Thy Lord</h2>
						<h3>Robinett Bibles</h3>
						<p>​Three Bibles, which were brought to America by Allen, are in existence today.<p>
						<p>The Bible used at his wedding is shown in the image.</p>
						<p>One of the Bibles, which he carried with him, was a small Bible, printed by John Field, Printer to the Parliament, London, 1653. On the fly-leaf is the inscription, "Allen Robanet, His Booke, 1653."</p>
						<p>The Bible was passed down through descendants of Allen's eldest son, and contains birth records of the children of Allen III, Marcus Hook, and Captain John Robinett. The Bible indicates that Allen was probably born in England, though possibly of French extraction.</p>
						<p>Allen Robinett was a man of some education, at a time when inability to write even one's name was not uncommon. His education is evidenced by his arraignment in the court of Chester County, December 10, 1689, for writing "sundry abusive papers" against John Bristow, one of the King's Justices for Tat County.</p>

						<h2>New Wales or Sylvania</h2>
						<h3>The Penn Colony and Land Purchase</h3>
						<p>Allen, Margaret and their two youngest children, Samuel and Sarah, came to America and purchased land from William Penn. His two older children, Allen and Susanna, emigrated to Maryland, possibly at an earlier date than Allen Senior. Allen lived in America for almost 12 years. The Penn land deed is in the Robinett collection at The Church of St Mary.</p>
						<p>Allen died June 5, 1694 in Upper Providence Township, Chester (now Delaware) County, Pennsylvania. His wife Margaret apparently predeceased him.  Both are buried either on their plantation in Upper Providence Township or in nearby Sandy Bank Graveyard on "Providence Great Road," now in the Borough of Media, PA.</p>

						<h1>The Story of the Church of St Mary</h1>

							<h2>From Foundation to the Great Fire: St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury 1200-1666</h2>
							<p>The story of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury is a story of survival - in the midst of rebellion, plague, fire, and war. Despite many calamities, this church has been an active place of worship for more than 800 years.

							The church was founded in the late 11th or early 12th century within what is now the historic City of London. Sometime before the 16th century it received an endowment from the "late Alderman Bury of London," acknowledged in the church's name.

							The parish and church grew with the City of London and shared all of its struggles. It survived both the English Reformation and Restoration, becoming one of the prominent Puritan parishes of the 17th century. Even civil war and plague did not stop the parish's development.

							But what social change and upheaval could not stop, fire did. On September 2, 1666 the Great Fire of London began, burning for five days. When it finally burned out, the city of London north of the Thames - including the entire parish of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury - lay in ruins.

							This was the prelude to the first rebirth of the church.</p>

						<h2>Back To The Drawing Board:  Rebuilding The Church</h2>
						<h3>The Phoenix of Aldermanbury:  Wren builds the Church</h3>
						<p>Like the mythical Phoenix - the bird reborn from fire to live again - St. Mary the Virgin, of Aldermanbury emerged from the ashes of London.

						With so much of London in ruin after the Great Fire, parish churches may not have been the first priority for reconstruction, and many churches were not rebuilt at all. However, St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury would be the ninth church restored, placing it among the earliest.

						With approval for rebuilding granted in 1670, work began in 1672 with the removal of 1,068 cubic yards of rubble. The church was rebuilt on part of the old foundation with as much original stone as could be salvaged - saving both time and money. By 1677, the work was essentially complete; the cupola was added to the tower in 1679.

						While Wren may not have personally drawn all the plans for St. Mary's, he undoubtedly was the guiding vision behind the design.

						St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury contains elements of both Renaissance Classical and Wren's own English Baroque style.</p>

						<h2>Falling To Pieces</h2>
						<h3>Bombed During The Blitz</h3>
						<p>In 1940 during the Blitz, the Church was gutted after a German incendiary bomb struck the center of the roof. For 25 years after the attack, the Church sat roofless and moss-grown, slated for demolition.

						It was in the early 1960's that the proposal was made for the creation of a museum to Sir Winston Churchill and his famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvax5VUvjWQ" />"Iron Curtain" speech</a>, which he delivered at Westminster College at the request of President Harry S. Truman, in 1946.</p>

				<h2>One man's trash...Worth Saving</h2>
				<h3>The Phoenix Rises, Again</h3>
				<p>"I am honoured... The removal of a ruined Christopher Wren Church, largely destroyed by enemy action in London in 1941 (sic), and its reconstruction and re-dedication at Fulton, is an imaginative concept..."
						~  Sir Winston Churchill on the Memorial Project Concept

				Westminster College's Bold Idea
				In 1961, College President Dr. Robert L.D. Davidson met with College friends and members of the St. Louis Chapter of the English Speaking Union to discuss a memorial to Winston Churchill. A recent Life magazine feature on war-ravaged Wren churches slated for demolition sparked the suggestion of importing one to serve as both a memorial and the college chapel. It was British Architect Patrick Horsborough who brought this to Dr Davidson's attention. Patrick was then active in bringing the church over. Further investigation proved St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury to be the clear choice, its size perfect for the campus.

				But this extraordinary architectural reconstruction plan was not without detractors. A British newspaper called it, "...the last word in sentimental extravagance... Besides it is no secret that... the City of London is glad to get rid of the smoke-charred ruins that have become an eyesore." An architecture student opined, "Hauling all of this rubble to America seems frightfully expensive."

				The project's champions, however, persevered. It took four years to secure permissions from the British Church and State, and to raise the necessary $2 million (more than $10 million today) to make the project a reality.</p>

			<h2>You did what?</h2>
			<h3>The Great Architectural Jigsaw Puzzle</h3>
			<p>A Moving Experience

				In 1965, the removal process began. Workers carefully labeled each of the 7,000 stones, noting their location in the church. More than 700 tons of blocks were shipped by boat to Virginia (The U.S. Shipping Board moved them as ship's ballast at no charge). From there, they traveled by rail. In the moving process, the carefully ordered stones became scrambled. Builders in Fulton faced a jigsaw puzzle that spread over an acre.</p>

			<h2>Humpty Dumpty Put Back Together Again</h2>
			<h3>A Church Restored</h3>
			<p>The foundation stone was laid in October 1966, 300 years after the Great Fire of London. The reconstruction was complicated by the fact that the original foundation upon which Wren built was not square, requiring continual adjustments in fitting the stone. But by May 1967 the last stone was in place.

				Meticulously re-creating the church's interior required another two years and a multinational effort. English woodcarvers, working from pre-war photographs, created carvings for the pulpit, baptismal font, and balcony. Blenko Glass, an American firm, manufactured the glass for the windows, and a Dutch firm cast five new bronze bells for the tower.

				Noel Mander, the fire warden who watched St. Mary's burn in 1940, built the organ and helped assure authenticity of the interior details. There are only two departures from the Wren design: an organ gallery in the west wall, and a window in the tower to illuminate the stairway.

				The Church, like the legendary phoenix, had risen once again from the ashes.</p>

			<h2>In Pursuit of Trivia</h2>
			<h3>Random Facts</h3>
			<p>Here are a few other random facts related to the story.
				<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Milton">John Milton, author of Paradise Lost</a>, is listed in the church registry as having married there on November 12, 1656.</li>
						<li>Henry Condell and John Heminges were key figures in the production of the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/shakespeares-first-folio">First Folio of William Shakespeare's plays</a> and co-partners with him in the Globe Theatre. Condell and Heminges lived in the St. Mary Aldermanbury parish and were buried in its churchyard.</li>
						<li>King Charles II of England owed $80,000 to Admiral Sir William Penn. In 1681, as payment for the debt, <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/penn/bio.htm">the king granted what is today Pennsylvania to the admiral's son, also named William Penn.</a> Penn named the territory New Wales. A Welsh member of Englands Privy Council objected, so Penn called it Sylvania (woods). The king changed the name to Pennsylvania, in honor of the admiral.</li>
